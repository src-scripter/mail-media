# mail-media
*A proposal for a serverless, privacy-friendly approach to social media to revolutionize how we connect with others online.*

Imagine interoperable social media platforms where you can easily move from one to another without having to worry about all your friends not being on there. Or imagine that you can have a free account without your data being sold as the hidden cost!

This is the idea behind the mail media concept.

With IMAP being a free feature from most email providers, we can make this concept reality by exchanging information through their infrastructure rather than a third party's or having to host our own instance. Every email can be written in a way that an app could search for certain keywords and load the information from said email into a post, reel, profile, and more.

Of course, at the moment there are certain drawbacks to mail media. How can a user trust the platform they are using to not read their other emails? How can a user's inbox verify an email came from the app and not a bad actor? And surely other things as well. However, if those could be worked out, there is a lot of potential to this idea. This would start a series of platforms that would never be made by corporations but rather by we the people.
